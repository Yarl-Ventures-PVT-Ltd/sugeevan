                <p>“I’m building from Jaffna on purpose.”</p>
                <p>
                    My long-term vision is to help make Jaffna a hub for IT and digital services, where talent can grow locally while delivering globally. I want young people to access high-standard opportunities without needing to leave home to find exposure. That means creating real companies, real products, and real delivery discipline that international partners can rely on.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is also why our work culture prioritizes professionalism, integrity, and quality. It’s how trust is built, and how a region earns its place on the global map.
